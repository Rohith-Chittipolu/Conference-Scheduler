Understand how the HTTP protocol works.
REST APIs are based on the HTTP protocol, which is the communication protocol used by the world wide web.
Understanding HTTP means knowing how URLs are structured, what actions you can express using HTTP methods, how you can express parameters in a request, 
and how to send or receive data.


Get a list of all the URLs to make the requests you need.
Every REST API offers a series of URLs to fetch, create, update, and delete data on a server. These are unique to each API. Their structure depends on the choices 
made by the developers that created the API. If you are lucky,your API of choice comes with proper documentation. Often though, especially 
when you interface with a private API, you have to talk to the server-side developers.


Perform a network request to get the data you need in your app.
By putting together the elements I listed above, you can write the code to perform a remote API call and get back some data. Data comes in different formats,
like binary data (for media files), JSON, XML, Markdown, HTML, or others.

Before you can use such data in your app, you have to parse it and convert to your model types. Binary data is usually directly convertible into the appropriate 
media types you find in the iOS SDK. In the case of structured data like JSON, parsing is also quite straightforward. For more complex formats like XML, 
Markdown, and HTML you might have to write a custom parser.
