Approach for Functionality:
As our research shown us crating api's and hosting them in a remote server and calling them for functionalities inside the app is a safe and reliable approach we are trying that approach.

## Change of approach <a name="ChangeOfApproach"></a>
* As designing and hosting of APIs is taking alot of time and getting a little complicated we decided to use google firebase as our database for both andriod and ios apps.
* From next week we will be working with the firebase and develop all the functionalities within xcode.
